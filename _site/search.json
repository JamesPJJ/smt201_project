The plan was to relocate the capital to a more central location of Indonesia, which would reduce the developmental inequality between Java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago and to reduce Jakarta’s burden as Indonesia’s primary hub.\r\nThis gave an opportunity for our group to embark on the journey to discover a suitable site for the relocation using site suitability analysis.\r\n2.0 Project Objective\r\nThe project aims to analyse the study area, East Kalimantan, in terms of the following:\r\nPopulation and demographic\r\nEconomic and Businesses\r\nTransport and Communication\r\nInfrastructure\r\nEnvironment and Hazard\r\nThere will be a site suitability analysis of the study area including its districts and sub-districts whereby the most suitable site would be recommended for the relocation.\r\n3.0 Scope of Work\r\nGather requirements\r\nCollect Data\r\n\r\nPerform EDA\r\nData extraction\r\nData integration\r\nData transformation\r\nData wrangling.\r\n\r\nDesigning and building GIS model and database based on the project requirements\r\nGather information/insights into various factors:\r\nPopulation and demographic\r\nEconomic and Businesses\r\nTransport and Communication\r\nInfrastructure\r\nEnvironment and Hazard\r\n\r\nPreparing report of survey\r\nPerforming site suitability analysis by integrating GIS and multi-criteria evaluation methods.\r\nPreparing site suitability analysis report including detailed discussion of the analysing methods used.\r\nPreparing poster and project webpage.\r\nShare what we learnt throughout the whole project\r\n4.0 Project Timeline/Schedule\r\nThe Education layer consists of locations of education institutions such as primary schools, secondary school, mixed and JC. We are only interested on education institutions that belong to primary and secondary schools.\r\n\r\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from last lesson, extract and save the primary and secondary schools in two separate GIS vector layers.\r\n\r\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\r\n\r\n5.0 Data Source\r\nIn this exercise, you will learn how to model raster data. The exercise focusses on how to rasterise a vector GIS data layer using QGIS geoprocessing functions.\r\n======= In this section, you will create a new field in the attribute table of a vector GIS data and update values of the newly created field. You will name the field as POI_CODE. The data type of this data field is integer.\r\nAt Browser panel, right-click on the Primary Schools layer. Select Open Attribute Table from the context menu.\r\nThe Attribute table dialog window of Primary Schools appears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
