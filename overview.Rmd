# 1.0	Project Motivation

Indonesia has planned to relocate their capital from Jakarta to Kalimantan. The plan was to relocate the capital to a more central location of Indonesia, which would reduce the developmental inequality between Java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago and to reduce Jakarta’s burden as Indonesia’s primary hub.

This gave an opportunity for our group to embark on the journey to discover a suitable site for the relocation using site suitability analysis.

# 2.0 Project Objectives
  
The project aims to analyse the study area, East Kalimantan, in terms of the following:

* Population and demographic
* Economic and Businesses
* Transport and Communication
* Infrastructure 
* Environment and Hazard

There will be a site suitability analysis of the study area including its districts and sub-districts whereby the most suitable site would be recommended for the relocation.

# 3.0 Scope of Work

*Gather requirements

# 4.0 Project Timeline/Schedule

The Education layer consists of locations of education institutions such as primary schools, secondary school, mixed and JC.  We are only interested on education institutions that belong to primary and secondary schools.

> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from last lesson, extract and save the primary and secondary schools in two separate GIS vector layers.    

Your screen should look similar to the figure below.

# 5.0 Data Source

In this exercise, you will learn how to model raster data.  The exercise focusses on how to rasterise a vector GIS data layer using QGIS geoprocessing functions.
